# Modelling the Pharmacokinetics of Pain Opioids (Methadone, Buprenorphine, Tramadol, and Tapentado)

## Approach
- We use a two compartment model for this analysis to compare the ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the drugs highlighted.
- The resulting differential equations are numerically solved using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method.

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
